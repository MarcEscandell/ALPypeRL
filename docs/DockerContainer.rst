Running ``alpyperl`` in a docker container
###########################################

If you are planning to develop your project in a **docker container**, you must be aware of the following:

* Connection between **python** and **AnyLogic** will potentially **fail**. This is due to *alpyperl* trying to connect to a port that is not mapped between the **docker container** and **docker host**.
* Howerver, this is possible when running with an **exported model** as execution of the model will take place in the container. In the terminal, AnyLogic will share the port in case you want to access the model UI.

  If you are planning to host your **trained policy** in a *docker container* you should apply the same logic: you must map the port to the host machine so it is accessible. Then, just remember to set the right port in the ``ALPypeRLConnector``.
