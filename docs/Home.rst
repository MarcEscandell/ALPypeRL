**ALPypeRL** or *AnyLogic Python Pipe for Reinforcement Learning* is an open source library that will allow you to create and run RL experiments using simulations build in the AnyLogic software. With this package, the user can dedicate their time to what it matters: building the right playground (AnyLogic simulation) for the RL policy to learn appropriately.

.. important::
    *Reinforcement Learning* algorithms are **specialists in identifying flaws** in a system (your *AnyLogic* model). That's why *ALPypeRL* puts special emphasis on **allowing users to observe policy actions while it learns** (during training), leading to **early bug detection**. Since *RL* training can be a lengthy process, it's critical to identify issues as soon as possible. Fortunately, *AnyLogic* is a powerful tool for creating detailed visualizations, making it easier to spot bugs in the model at earlier stages.

***********
Features
***********
With **ALPypeRL** you will be able to:

* Connect your AnyLogic model to a reinforcement learning framework of your choise (e.g. ray ``rllib``).
* Scale your training by launching many AnyLogic models simultaneously (*requires an exported model*).
* Deploy and evaluate your trained policy from AnyLogic.
* Debug your AnyLogic models during training (*this is a special feature unique to ALPypeRL that improves the user experience during model debugging remarkably*).
* Leverage on the AnyLogic rich visualization while training or evaluating (*which ties to the previous bullet point*).


************
Environments
************

*ALPypeRL* includes 2 environments that make the **connection between AnyLogic and your python scrip** possible:

* :ref:`ALPypeRLConnector<The AnyLogic Connector>`. The **AnyLogic connector** library to be dropped into your simulation model.
* :ref:`alpyperl<How to train your first policy. The CartPole-v0 example.>`. The library that you will use after configuring your policy in your python script to connect to the AnyLogic model (includes functionalities to **train** and **evaluate**). 

************
Installation
************

* You must add ``ALPypeRLConnector`` in your **AnyLogic Palette**. Download the **jar** file :download:`here<../bin/ALPypeRLLibrary.jar>` and follow the :ref:`instructions<The AnyLogic Connector>`.

    .. warning::
        **The** ``ALPypeRLConnector`` **requires additional configuration steps!** It is not enougth to drag and drop an instance. Please read the :ref:`documentation<The AnyLogic Connector>`.

* To install the base **alpyperl** library in python, use:

    .. code-block:: console
        
        pip install alpyperl

************
Requirements
************

* The **ALPypeRL** requires you to have the **AnyLogic software** (or a valid exported model). AnyLogic is a licensed software for building simulations that includes an ample variety of libraries for modelling many industry challenges. At the moment, AnyLogic provides a *free* license under the name PLE (Personal Learning Edition). There are other options available. For more information, you can visit the `AnyLogic website <https://www.anylogic.com/>`_.

.. note::
    This is not a package that is currently backed by the AnyLogic support team.

* The python package ``alpyperl`` requires (among others) 4 packages that are relatively heavy (and might take longer times to install depending on the host machine specs):

    * ``ray``
    * ``ray[rllib]``
    * ``tensorflow``
    * ``torch``

********************
General architecture
********************

The ALPypeRL library consists of 2 artifacts (as mentioned earlier):

* The **ALPypeRL Connector** or **ENVIRONMENT**. If you are familiar with the AnyLogic terms, this object has been basically built from a base ``Agent``. It is in charge of creating a connection from the **java** side. **AnyLogic** works as the platform to create environments to be used by the *policy*.
  
* The python **alpyperl** package or **POLICY**. This library will create the connection from the **python** side. Also, you will find other capabilities such as policy deployment.

Here there's an overall diagram to how *ALPypeRL* connection is built:

Reinforcement learning basics
******************************

If you're new to the field of Reinforcement Learning, a highly recommended resource to learn in-depth about its workings is `OpenAI Spinning Up <https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/>`_. It is considered one of the best **free educational** resources currently available for *Reinforcement Learning*.

As explained in `wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning>`_:

..

    **Reinforcement learning (RL)** is an area of **machine learning** concerned with how **intelligent agents** ought to **take actions** in an **environment** in order to **maximize** the notion of cumulative **reward**. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

    Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs to be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).

If you want to relate what has been explained to *ALPypeRL* we can say that:

* The **intelligent agents that take decisions** are the *policies* trained (e.g. using ``rllib``). You will need the python package ``alpyperl`` for dealing with agents. Agent/Policy learning happens in *ALPypeRL* on the *python* side.

* The **environment** that is used as the *playground* for the policy to learn from via **observation** collection happens on the *AnyLogic* side. This is all connected thanks to the ``ALPypeRLConnector`` and the implementation of the required ``ALPypeRLClientController`` functions. After taking an **action**, a **reward** is generated, and the *agent* works towards maximizing its *cumulative* value.
